# Project Description:
- The Smart Surveillance System for Anomaly Actions Recognition is a computer vision and machine learning based system that is designed to detect and recognize anomalous actions within a surveillance video feed. 
- The system uses advanced algorithms to analyze video footage in real-time and identify any abnormal behavior or actions, This can include actions such as shoplifting, theft, or other criminal activities.
- The system utilizes deep learning algorithms to recognize and classify actions within the video feed. The system is trained on a large dataset of normal and anomalous actions, allowing it to accurately identify and flag any unusual activity. The system can also integrate with existing surveillance cameras and security systems, making it easy to implement and use in a variety of settings.

# The project main goals are:
- To improve the surveillance efficiency and security by detecting and recognizing anomalous actions in real-time.
- To reduce the need for human monitoring by automating the process of identifying unusual behavior.
- To integrate with existing surveillance systems, making it easy to implement and use in different settings.

# Technologies used:
 - Computer Vision
 - Deep Learning
 - Python
 - OpenCV
 - TensorFlow
 - OpenCV
 - Keras

The project will be implemented in several stages, starting with data collection and pre-processing, then training the model and fine-tuning it, and finally testing and evaluating the system in a real-world scenario.
